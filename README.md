# Create a Leaflet Map for Subway Stations in Ä°zmir using Leaflet in R

Recently, Izmir Metropolitan Municipality announced the foundation of the Open Data Platfrom. Thereby, They make a contribution to the both data literature for Turkey and the management mechanism in Local Authorities. Izmir also becomes the second Metropolitan Municipality in Turkey having a open data platform. 

Here, I use the dataset of subway stations in Izmir and create a map using Leaflet in R. 

This is the result, it looks like a plot representing a pure linear relationship huh?
